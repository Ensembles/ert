Here you can select which type of simulation to run.<br>
1. Ensemble Experiment: this will run simulations without performing any updates on the parameters.<br>
2. Ensemble Smoother: this will run simulations while performing one update on the parameters by using the ensemble smoother algorithm.<br>
3. Iterated Ensemble Smoother: this will run simulations while performing multiple updates on the parameters by using the iterated ensemble smoother algorithm.
