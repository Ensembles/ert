Package with utility classes, used by other ERT classes.

The libutil library implements many utility functions and classes of
things like hash table and vector; these classes are extensively used
by the other ert libraries. The present wrapping here is to facilitate
use and interaction with various ert classes, in a pure python context
you are probably better served by using a plain python solution;
either based on built in python objects or well established third
party packages.

The modules included in the util package are:

  tvector.py: This module implements the classes IntVector,
     DoubleVector and BoolVector. This is a quite normal
     implementation of a typed growable vector; but with a special
     twist regarding default values.

  util_func.py: This module wraps a couple of stateless (i.e. there is
     no class involved) functions from the util.c file.

# The libert_util library requires the libraries libz, libblas and
# liblapack. It is assumed that the library has been compiled with a
# suitable RPATH option (i.e. ERT_USE_RPATH has been set to True in
# the build process) and we 'just' load the final libert_util library
# directly. In principle it would be possible preload these libraries
# with calls like:
#
# clib.load("libz" , "libz.so.1")
# clib.load("libblas" , "libblas.so" , "libblas.so.3")
# clib.load("liblapack" , "liblapack.so")
