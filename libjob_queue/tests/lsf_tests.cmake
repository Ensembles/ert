# The testing of the lsf submit capabilities is quite troublesome for
# two reasons, and therefor by default disabled:
#
#
#  1. The shell based LSF commands require that user running the
#     bsub/bjobs/bxxx command has passwordless ssh configured to log in
#     to the lsf server. When the build and testing is run as a common
#     'jenkins' user this becomes difficult.
#
#  2. Submitting through the lsf library requires that the build/test
#     server actually is a LIM host; which it typically is not.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This should be a space separated list of servers which will be 
# tried out when testing the LSF submit capability. The test program
# will interpret the special strings 'NULL' and 'LOCAL' as follows:
#
#   NULL:  Submit using the linked in library functions.
#   LOCAL: Submit using shell commands on the current server
#
