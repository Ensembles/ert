"""
The cwrap package contains several small utility modules to simplify
the process of interacting with a C library:

  clib: This module contains the function load() which will load a
     shared library using the ctypes.CDLL(); the function has
     facilities for trying several different names when loading the
     library.

  cwrap: This module contains support for a Python <-> C type map. The
     whole type mapping in the ert python bindings is based on this
     module.

  cfile: This module implemenets the class CFILE which can be used to
     extract the underlying FILE pointer from a Python filehandle, to
     facilitate use of Python filehandles for functions expecting a
     FILE pointer.
