Package with utility classes, used by other ERT classes.

The libutil library implements many utility functions and classes of
things like hash table and vector; these classes are extensively used
by the other ert libraries. The present wrapping here is to facilitate
use and interaction with various ert classes, in a pure python context
you are probably better served by using a plain python solution;
either based on built in python objects or well established third
party packages.

The modules included in the util package are:

  tvector.py: This module implements the classes IntVector,
     DoubleVector and BoolVector. This is a quite normal
     implementation of a typed growable vector; but with a special
     twist regarding default values.

  util_func.py: This module wraps a couple of stateless (i.e. there is
     no class involved) functions from the util.c file.
